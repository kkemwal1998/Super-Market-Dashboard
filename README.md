# Project Description: Customer Transaction Analysis for Supermarket Chain

# Project Overview:
This project analyzes customer transaction data for a supermarket chain with branches in Yangon, Naypyitaw, and other locations, focusing on identifying spending patterns, customer preferences, and payment trends. By examining variables such as transaction amounts, branch locations, payment methods, customer types, and product lines, this analysis aims to uncover valuable insights that can drive strategic decision-making.

# Project Tools: Power BI

# Data Model Relation : Many to many relationship (Bi-directional filteration)

# Key Objectives
Transaction Spending Analysis
Evaluate the total spending per customer for each transaction, capturing the average and peak transaction values across different branches and customer demographics.

# Branch and City-Based Spending Patterns
Assess customer spending patterns by branch and city, pinpointing which locations see the highest spending volumes. This insight will help in identifying key revenue-driving locations and allocating resources to high-performing areas.

# Customer Payment Preferences
Analyze the most frequently used payment methods (Cash, Credit Card, Ewallet) across different customer types and branches. This will support the supermarket in optimizing the payment process to meet customer preferences effectively.

# Customer Type and Product Line Popularity
Investigate the popularity of product lines (e.g., Health and Beauty, Home and Lifestyle, Electronic Accessories) among customer types (Member or Normal). This analysis will help in customizing product offerings and marketing strategies based on customer profiles.

# Expected Outcomes
The project will deliver actionable insights into the spending habits, preferred payment methods, and product preferences of the supermarket’s diverse customer base. These findings will support data-driven decisions in resource allocation, inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer engagement initiatives across the supermarket chain.

# Key Insights:

-E-Wallet as Preferred Payment Method
   Initiative: Enhance and promote the E-Wallet experience across all branches. Offer incentives such as cashback, loyalty points, or discounts for E-Wallet transactions to     encourage continued use and attract tech-savvy customers. Additionally, consider partnerships with popular e-wallet providers to introduce exclusive offers or integrated     payment options within the supermarket's app.

-Branch C as a Key Revenue Driver
  Initiative: Invest in Branch C by increasing inventory, staffing, and marketing efforts to meet demand and maximize revenue. Consider creating a localized marketing          campaign to further engage Branch C’s high-spending customer base. Additionally, evaluate the layout and customer flow at Branch C to optimize the shopping experience and    encourage more purchases.

-Popular Product Lines: Beverages and Food
  Initiative: Expand the range and availability of beverages and food products, potentially introducing new or exclusive items within these categories to capitalize on their   popularity. Seasonal promotions, in-store tastings, or bundle offers could drive sales further. Partnering with local food and beverage brands could also attract customers   interested in locally sourced products.

-Majority of Spending Customers are Members
  Initiative: Strengthen the membership program by introducing tiered rewards, exclusive discounts, and early access to sales events. To attract more members, implement        referral programs and perks like birthday discounts or member-exclusive product previews. Building a sense of community and exclusivity around the membership could enhance   customer loyalty and increase spending.
